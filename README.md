# AI-Powered Interview Assistant (Crisp)

A React app that works as an AI-powered interview assistant with chat for candidates and a dashboard for interviewers. The system allows candidates to upload their resume, collect missing information, conduct a timed AI-generated interview, and automatically score and summarize the candidate. Interviewers can view candidates’ progress, chat history, and final scores.
